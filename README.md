## Synopsis

A project developed for Embedded Computational Systems at Instituto Superior Técnico. This project is intended to work with **Microchip's 44-pin PICDEM-2 Board** (based on the **PIC18F4520 microcontroller**) and a normal **PC** (using and **Ubuntu** based Linux OS). Microchip's board is programmed to be running as a **clock with a temperature/luminosity sensor and alarm capabilities**. It also has the capability to **store read values**, as they change, to an **internal EEPROM** and to communicate through an **RS-232 serial line** with the chosen PC. This is done with resource to the eCOS multitasking kernel (http://ecos.sourceware.org/). 

## Code Example

For the moment, we have none. Updates coming!

## Motivation

As stated in the synopsis, this project was developed for Embedded Computational Systems class at Instituto Superior Técnico.

## Installation
[Still on the works... eCos is confusing]
Apart from eCos, no installation is needed (official how-to: http://ecos.sourceware.org/getstart.html).

That being said, the official steps can be somewhat hard to follow, therefore we **advice that you follow the following steps**: http://www.rte.se/blog/blogg-modesty-corex/ecos-real-time-operating-system/2.15 and check on http://www.ecoscentric.com/devzone/configtool.shtml just to make sure everything version is up-to-date (should be). You might have to change some paths, so if you are just copy-pasting and there are errors, don't give up!

## API Reference

For the moment, we have none. Updates coming!

## Tests

For the moment, we have none. Updates coming!
